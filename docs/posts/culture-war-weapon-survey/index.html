<p>Culture wars have always been around, but nowadays social media has enabled the ability to scale them out to an unprecedented degree.  The structure of how content is shared means exposure is possible on a global scale, as well as there being more data available on how consumers can be influenced.  The values of the (American) social media platforms also feature, influenced by their own economics, philosophies and governments.</p>

<p>These platforms I think are not healthy for political debate as I will reason below, a belief that means I work to actively avoid politics on those platforms by unfollowing or blocking political activity.  However, I sacrifice the impression that I don&rsquo;t care about those issues, so this article explains some of my reasons on why I think social media and politics are a bad combination.</p>

<h2 id="symptoms-of-a-dysfunctional-political-debate">Symptoms of a dysfunctional political debate</h2>

<p>Increased polarization of opinion is encouraged by how social media platforms engage users.  Personalised &lsquo;filter bubbles&rsquo; mean that users on the platforms experience a reflection of reality that is different from others, with news only confirming their own bias.  When exposed to differing beliefs it is often framed by enraged peers denouncing its content, content that reads like a denial of an assumed objective established reality. This denial of &lsquo;reality&rsquo; helps reinforce that the other side peddle in lies and perhaps more importantly that they know they are lying. Trust is destroyed along with chances to compromise.  Both sides think they hold the only Truth.</p>

<p>There is also the concept of signalling to help confirm what side of the culture gap you are in.  As well as combatants subscribing to positions of their own group, there is a need to strongly signal you are not associated with the enemy.  This can be achieved by publicly dismissing or attacking positions on the other side, not aiming to win the argument but only to show where you belong for your peers.  In fact, the more visibly outraged you can make the other side, the stronger the signal to your peers that you are one of them.  Many professional trollers rely on this to make an income.</p>

<p>This means a lot of online &lsquo;discussion&rsquo; is essentially useless for aims of changing actual points of view and practical change of policy, and is more for the benefit of the participants self-identity.  What may be worse is that a published position on social media may replace actual real action to address the underlying issue. Brands advertising their diversity in adverts but not actually hiring or paying minorities the same wage is one example, which helps fuel the distrust that the other side doesn’t actually believe in the cause, and are just taking positions for selfish image reasons.</p>

<h2 id="non-aggression-pacts-in-culture-wars">Non-Aggression Pacts in Culture Wars</h2>

<p>I argue that engaging in these attacks are a problem in itself, as to actually further your own cause a principal must be that political compromise and listening to others point of view is a necessary step to create a stronger society for all.  Until we have the ability for everyone to freely live in personalised universes to match our newsfeeds, we must find ways to co-exist.  This is not to say that truths must always be &lsquo;other sided&rsquo; with lies.  But it does demand that we examine why the other side exists beyond &ldquo;they are stupid&rdquo;, and to identify the reasons how they arrived at that position.</p>

<p>Co-existence is not achieved by thinking the other side is &ldquo;evil&rdquo; and your point of view must be imposed on them for their own self-good - in fact having such a view can be long-term detrimental to your cause. The default positions are encouraged to get more extreme and failure to keep up will leave you branded as a conspirator.  This has left a widening political centre that is less vocal than those on the extreme wings in the fear they will be branded as an outsider (see &lsquo;cancel culture&rsquo;), weakening society as minority views become louder, disregarding the silent central majority.</p>

<p>Take for example the Trump and Brexit votes from 2016.  An outraged Left could not see why someone on the Right would want to vote for such disruptive changes, as they believed the majority were benefiting from the status-quo.  Yet it could be said it was a failure of the Left to make those benefits available to everyone that has caused enough wide-reaching resentment for voters to reject that status-quo, and vote for any disruptive change that may or may not bring them more benefit.  Those voices should be heard, and not dismissed or shouted at until they change their mind, yet as labels of Main Stream Media and Alternative Facts show, people do not feel represented by institutions and have sought alternatives. Politicians recognise that and turn the resentment into votes.</p>

<p>I also want to be clear that I think both sides take part in this war, it&rsquo;s not for example the innocent Left under attack by the Right.  An easy way to see that is to look at the language used by the Left at that section of society whom perhaps the Left feel should be on their side but are not.  Usually poor white people.  For them is reserved the harsh rhetoric such as rednecks, chavs, poor white trash, gammons etc. and hastens those people to feel like they are underrepresented.</p>

<p>Add to this mix actions by third parties who have an interest in destroying the status quo.  Consensus weakening is being encouraged by enemies of democracy, who use the ability to automate social media reactions and the failures of the social media platforms to drive a wedge between groups, in many cases creating sock puppet accounts on both sides of the debate to facilitate it.  The actual points of view are immaterial - stirring up conflict, mistrust and getting people to disengage are the win conditions.</p>

<p>To help identify this, and as a bookmark on current trends that rapidly change, the list below will attempt to document phrases and concepts that each side of the culture wars uses.  The easiest source for these is to look at what the sock puppet accounts are saying, which are at the moment fairly easy to identify.  If you find yourself using these phrases, it may be you are part of the problem, or being influenced by those enemies of democracy.  Disclosure for myself is that I in the past would have identified myself as &ldquo;Left&rdquo; but after identifying this problem of &lsquo;them vs us&rsquo; will now identify as &ldquo;Centre-Left with some Centre-Right economics&rdquo; - the subtleties of a graduated position being one of the main casualties of a culture war since it demands that participants agree with all the policy points of one side or another.</p>

<h2 id="culture-war-weapons">Culture War Weapons</h2>

<p>This is a tough list to try to curate from a neutral, central point of view and is uncomfortable to write as it feels like it is bound to offend.  I&rsquo;ve tried to keep it to the insults and slurs directed at the other side.  Note I&rsquo;m not naive enough to say that there are not people with extremist positions alluded to in the slurs, but my point is to label everyone on the other side to those extreme positions is the abandoning of the centre, consensus politics that is needed to improve society.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll try to sum up the reasons behind the weapons.  I am a UK/Denmark citizen so my interpretations are in that context.</p>

<h3 id="left-weapons-for-use-on-the-right">Left weapons for use on the Right</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>That leader is a dysfunctional, philandering, profiteering, misleading, embarrassing, alcoholic, racist slob &amp; that applies to his imbecilic cohorts too</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Stupid racist

<ul>
<li>For example, a big problem when discussing immigration policies is the automatic labelling or people who didn&rsquo;t want unrestricted free movement as racist. When towns with rapidly changing populations of different cultures had integration problems, expressing concerns but to be shut down as being racist undoubtedly drove resentment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Nazi / Fascist

<ul>
<li>Used by both sides, for the left this is usually for moves perceived to move towards police state or authoritarian government</li>
</ul></li>
<li>White nationalists

<ul>
<li>Generally as demographics shift white groups who are struggling and perceive those problems as simply a question of race will look to defend their creed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Alternative facts

<ul>
<li>This started on the Left but was quickly co-opted by the Right.  The original meaning was aimed at the far-right popularist publications outside of the more left-leading &ldquo;mainstream media&rdquo;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gammon Brexiters

<ul>
<li>UK term for the stereotype of uneducated skinhead muscle men who may go out binge drinking in the sun so turning pink in the sun.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Toxic masculinity

<ul>
<li>Men who reject feminism as it applies to men, and subscribe that men must embrace the more negative aspects of male stereotypes or not be &lsquo;real men&rsquo;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Homophobe

<ul>
<li>This is one of the positions that has slowly drifted away from one particular side, as prominent homesexual people appear on the right too, but there is still a large majority who don&rsquo;t agree anything other than hetrosexual orientation should exist.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Zionist

<ul>
<li>The Israel/Palestine conflict is a key flag for identifying which side of the fence you are on, despite the complexities of the issue.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Russian puppet

<ul>
<li>A curious shift that now has the Left more aggressive towards Russia being the enemy than the Right did only a few years ago.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Victim blaming

<ul>
<li>The right perceive that the left is too soft on criminals apart from when</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tax evader

<ul>
<li>If you are not contributing to society via tax</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Climate denier

<ul>
<li>The Right are generally perceived as not respecting climate science as they monetarily gain from the status quo of using fossil fuels</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mask denier

<ul>
<li>If you are not wearing a mask, you are risking lives during a pandemic</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="right-weapons-for-use-on-the-left">Right weapons for use on the Left</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m sick of Islam, Black Lives Matter, Antifa, Extinction Rebellion and I&rsquo;m especially sick of the MSM, led by the BBC, promoting their anti-British views to the detriment of our centuries old culture, religion and history!</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Woke / Virtue Signalling

<ul>
<li>It implies that the people talking about minority politics or politically correct issues do not actually believe them, but wish to signal they do for status</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Racist

<ul>
<li>Usually for actions that are detrimental to whites, co-opted from the Left for minority politics that signal out race issues, such as Black Lives Matter, as non-inclusive for Whites</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Leftists / Libs

<ul>
<li>General term for the other side</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Politically Correct

<ul>
<li>Now used as a derisive term for those users subscribing to minority politics</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Socialist / Communist

<ul>
<li>Anti-capitalism is frowned upon, government intervention in citizens lives is always to be fought against</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Triggered / Snowflake

<ul>
<li>When the Right troll the Left to respond to injustices, but increasingly used by both sides</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Fake News of MSM

<ul>
<li>There is a general feeling that mainstream media is a left-leaning institution meaning it is not to be trusted.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Beta males

<ul>
<li>The belief feminism has emasculated men so that they are now subservient to women.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Deep state

<ul>
<li>Conspiracy that the civil service systems of government operate without democractic oversight, for the takeover of the world, often including pedophile rings.  In my time this has drifted from Left to Right.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Antifa/BLM Terrorist

<ul>
<li>Anti-fascists and Black Lives Matters are regarded as enemies of the state disrupting the established order</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Poor are Workshy free brigade

<ul>
<li>Socialism creates a society of people dependant on state benefits</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Unpatriotic (Anti-American, Anti-British, Anti-X)

<ul>
<li>Challenging the established conservative nationalism myths</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Climate change hoax

<ul>
<li>The Left are perceived to only want Green policies as they will gain control over industry and restrict personal freedoms</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t use masks

<ul>
<li>That the right doesn&rsquo;t think wearing masks is necessary is one the latest weapons that fits into a general theme that the Left create over-state disasters to force others to do what they want in a drift towards socialism / communism</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>From the list above, it strikes me how contradictory and fluid some of the terms are and how over time they move across boundaries as former slurs get co-opted as badges of honour.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-we-do-instead">What can we do instead?</h2>

<p>I don’t know, but I feel I know what we shouldn’t. I guess amplifying the voices of center politics and stressing consensus is an end goal, but how to get there will be difficult. How do we come to trust each other more?</p>

<p>American comments on UK/Danish politics are typically very off-base as they are only thought of in the context of the USA - likewise my comments on the USA will have UK/Danish bias so I will leave that to them.</p>

<h3 id="representative-politics">Representative politics</h3>

<p>At the end of the day I think all divisions boil down to the rich vs the poor, so decreasing the wealth gap will help divisive politics having fertile ground.</p>

<p>Having better representation such as proportional representation is also a step in the right direction, to help get non-represented voices heard before they get angry.  For instance, UKIP voters never had many MPs despite having a large percentage of the vote, which drove support towards Brexit.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m with Popper thinking that the aim of democracy is to reduce concentration of power, so anything to help break the duopoly of politics should also naturally help with polarization of politics. A big bureaucratic state becomes too powerful and people start resenting their powerlessness.  A minority of very rich people also represents a concentration of power, so whilst keeping the opportunities levelling out the wealth gap would also serve to avoid too much power concentration.</p>

<h3 id="social-media-self-regulation">Social media (self?) regulation</h3>

<p>Social media platforms are now editors of opinion, and the gatekeepers of political thought instead of high quality journalism.  This will hopefully evolve down the same conclusions that newspapers took, but for now I am very cautious where I get my news - anything that confirms my bias or appeals to emotions should be examined carefully.  I take the view that all politics should be considered and not knee-jerk and so actively block, mute or unfollow accounts that are too involved in the culture wars above. Don&rsquo;t feed the trolls.</p>

<p>Online talk is always different from in-person interaction.  Getting to know the underlying emotion on why something is said is what is needed for communication, that is lost via click bait titles, emails and texts.  Talk about these things in person, with differing points of view respected.  Hearing someone talk doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to agree with what they said.  To gain trust in one another we need to interact beyond words on a screen, and remember that we are all humans struggling with our own existence, with a lot more in common than differences between us.
Perspectives that bind us together, such as a shared culture are lacking these days in the personalised media world we are in now - the greatest effect in the end may have to be driven by the social media companies themselves, which if they truly have a mission of &lsquo;making the world a better place&rsquo; as their silicon valley ethos is supposed to believe, will do so willingly without the need for governments to step in, how may be powerless to do so if the culture wars continue to escalate. We are in their hands.</p>
